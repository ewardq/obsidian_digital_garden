Make a hexdump or do the reverse.

_xxd_ creates a hex dump of a given file or standard input. It can also convert a hex dump back to its original binary form. Like _**[uuencode](https://linux.die.net/man/1/uuencode)**(1)_ and _**[uudecode](https://linux.die.net/man/1/uudecode)**(1)_ it allows the transmission of binary data in a 'mail-safe' ASCII representation, but has the advantage of decoding to standard output. Moreover, it can be used to perform binary file patching.
