## What is the Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) protocol?

I2C is a synchronous, multi-controller/multi-target (historically termed as multi-master/multi-slave), single-ended, serial communication bus invented in 1982 by Philips Semiconductors. [^1]

Widely used for attaching lower-speed peripheral integrated circuits (I2C) to processors and microcontrollers in short-distance intra-board communication.

_Characteristics_
- Synchronous (Has a clock signal).
- Multi-controller / Multi-target.
- Single-ended.
- Serial communication bus.

> [!tip] Important
> One particular strength of I2C is the capability of a microcontroller to control a network of device chips with just **two** general-purpose I/O pins and software.
