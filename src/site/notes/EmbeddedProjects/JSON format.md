JSON is a ==lightweight format for data interchange==, easy to read and write, making it ideal for embedded systems.

![coverimg | 200](https://cdn3.iconfinder.com/data/icons/type-file-working-office-online-set-the-surname-us/53/json-type-1024.png)

JSON structures data as **key-value pairs**, often using arrays and nested objects.

_Example of json object_
```json
{
	"device_id": "STM32_001",
	"temperature": 24.5,
	"humidity": 60,
	"timestamp": 1625585599
}
```

JSON is widely supported across programming languages, has a ==compact structure==, and is easy to parse, making it a preferred format for transmitting data in [[EmbeddedProjects/RESTful API\|RESTful API]]s.
