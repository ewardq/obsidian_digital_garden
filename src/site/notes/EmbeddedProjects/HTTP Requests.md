The [[Linux Essentials/Topic 4/HTTP\|HTTP]] protocol is the foundation of [[EmbeddedProjects/RESTful API\|RESTful API]]s, enabling communication between clients and servers.

The core HTTP methods are used to perform **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources, essential for managing data in IoT applications:

- ==GET:== **Requests data from server.** In IoT, this might be used to retrieve the latest sensor data.
- ==POST:== **Submits new data to the server.** For example, an IoT device might use POST to send temperature readings to a server.
