This circuit amplifies the audio coming from an audio jack (connected to a smartphone or an ipod) with the help of a dual op amp circuit (UTC2822). The rest of the circuit helps condition the signal.

Here, the op amp amplifies the music so it can be used in the output speakers.

To implement this operational amplifiers into **two** cannels so we can have a stereo (two speakers) audio, we are going to use a simple two amp integrated circuit:

Finally, the implemented schematic from the first image in this page looks like this:
