A Microcontroller (MCU, Î¼C) is a small computer system on a single chip. But its resources and capacilities such as memory, speed, external interfaces are very much limited than of a desktop computer because the MCU targets embedded applications.

A typical microcontroller includes:

 - Processsor
 - Volatile memory
 - Non-volatile memory
 - Input/Output (I/O) pins
 - Peripherals
 - Clock
 - Bus interfaces

 All == on a single chip.==

 This is also why a microcontrollers is usually called a **System on Chip.**
