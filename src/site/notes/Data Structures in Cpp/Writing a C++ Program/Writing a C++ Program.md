## Writing a C++ Program

Every C++ program must contain a starting point. By the C++ standard, the starting point is a function:

```c++
int main()
```

By ___convention___, the return value of main is `0` (zero) if the program was successful and non-zero on errors.

 C++ is a **strongly typed** programming language where every variable has a type, name, value and location in memory.
