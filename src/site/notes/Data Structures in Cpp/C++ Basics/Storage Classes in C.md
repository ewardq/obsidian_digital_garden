The storage classes in the C language decides:
- ==Scope of a variable.==
- ==Visibility of a variable or function.==
- ==Life time of a variable.==

**Scope**, **visibility** and **lifetime** are features of a variable. These features can be modified by using storage class specifiers.

There are two widely used storage class specifiers in C:
- [[static keyword \| static]]
- [[extern keyword \| extern]]
