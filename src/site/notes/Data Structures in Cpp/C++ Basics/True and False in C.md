In "C", Zero is interpreted as FALSE and anything non-zero is interpreted as true.

`0` ==> `FALSE`
`1` ==> `TRUE`
`-1` ==> `TRUE`
`999999999` ==> `TRUE`

Expressions using relational operators evaluate to a value of either TRUE (1) or FALSE (0)

Relational expressions are often used within `if` and `while` statements.
