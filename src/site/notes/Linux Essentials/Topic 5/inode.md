### Inode

An _inode_ is a data structure that stores attributes for an object (like a file or directory) on a filesystem. Among those attributes are the filename,permissions, ownership and on which blocks of the disk the data for the object is stored. Think of it as an entry on an index, hence the name, which comes from “index node”.
