# Where Data is Stored
For an operating system, everything is considered data. For Linux, _everything is considered a file_: 
- Programs
- Regular files
- Directories
- Block devices (hard disks, etc.)
- Character devices (consoles, etc.)
- Kernel processes
- Sockets
- Partitions
- Links
- etc.

The Linux directory structure, starting from the `root /` , is a collection of files containing data. The fact that everything is a file is a powerful feature of Linux as it ___allows for tweaking virtually every single aspect of the system.___
