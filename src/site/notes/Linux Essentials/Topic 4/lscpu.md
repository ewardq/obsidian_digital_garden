**lscpu**Â gathers CPU architecture information from sysfs and /proc/cpuinfo. The command output can be optimized for parsing or for easy readability by humans.  
The information includes, for example, the number of CPUs, threads, cores, sockets, and Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) nodes. There is also information about the CPU caches and cache sharing, family, model, bogoMIPS, byte order, and stepping.
