_ps_ gives a snapshot of processes. Sot it is static and does not update unless it's called again.

| Description --    | It is the unique identifier associated with that process. Multiple process from the same program have different PIDs. | It is the terminal that executed a particular commmand. | CPU utilization of process or thread, incremented each time the system clock ticks and the process or thread is found to be running. | It is the program that executed the command. |

A common way to use the _ps_ command is with the `-a` flag to **select all processes except both session leaders and processes not associated with a terminal**, the `u` flag to **select by effective user ID (EUID) or name; selecting only the processes belonging to a username present in [[userlist\|userlist]]** and the `x` flag to select **any of the users**.

`ps -aux`
