When a distribution is launched, there is a period of time where it is _supported_, that is, a period of time where the organization in charge of that distribution will fix bugs and update the software. After that time, it is considered **obsolete**.

_Ubuntu:_ It usually launches a version every **6 months** but it has a Long Term Support (LTS) version with **5 years** of continuous support.

_Red Hat Enterprise Linux:_ Has support for **10 years**.

_Debian:_ Release cycle of **2 years**. It always has a Testing version, a Unstable version and the final Stable version.
