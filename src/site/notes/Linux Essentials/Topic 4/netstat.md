`netstat --help`

Here are some useful flags, such as `-t` we get the active internet connections that use the TCP protocol.

`netstat -t`

or the UDP protocol.
`netstat -u`

You can also see all the process with ports that are currently **listening**. ___Who is making contact with my server?___

`netstat -l`

As an example, we can see what are the **processes** (`p`) that have open ports (`l`) with the IPv4 protocol (`t4`).

`netstat -tl4p`
