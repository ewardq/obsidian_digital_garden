**Route** manipulates the kernel's IP routing tables. Its primary use is to set up static routes to specific hosts or networks via an interface after it has been configured with the _**[ifconfig](https://linux.die.net/man/8/ifconfig)**(8)_ program.

When the **add** or **del** options are used, **route** modifies the routing tables. Without these options, **route** displays the current contents of the routing tables.
