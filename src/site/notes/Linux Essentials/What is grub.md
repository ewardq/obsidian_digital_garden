[GRUB](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/) is a complete program for loading and managing the boot process. It is the most common bootloader for Linux distributions. A bootloader is the first software that runs when a computer starts. It loads the [kernel of the operating system](https://itsfoss.com/what-is-linux/) and then the kernel initializes the rest of the operating system: shell, [display manager](https://itsfoss.com/display-manager/), [desktop environment](https://itsfoss.com/what-is-desktop-environment/), etc.
