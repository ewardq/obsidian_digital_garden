Most commands at the command line follow the same basic structure:

> [!Command line basic structure]
>    ___command___ _\[option(s) /  parameter(s)...\]_ **\[argument(s)...\]**

Take the following command as an example:

>$ ___ls___ _-l_ **/home**

where the ___ls___ command lists all the files present in the arguments directory, the _-l_ option modifies the behavior so it will show a long format for the **/home** directory.
