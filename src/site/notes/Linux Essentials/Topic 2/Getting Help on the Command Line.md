# Getting Help on the Command Line
The most common ways to get help in Linux is with:
- [[Linux Essentials/Topic 2/man\|man]]: Extensive help and information about a command or directory.
- [[info\|info]]: A more modern approach to the _man_ command, more detailed information formatted in hypertext similar to a web page.
- [[locate\|locate]]: Searches within a database and then outputs every name that matches the given string. **Supports regular expressions and wildcards**.
- _/usr/share/doc/_: Documentation for a given software. Licenses, library documentation, etc.
- _-h_ or _--help_: Quick help with familiar commands or their arguments.
