# Licenses
_copyleft_: This initiative backed by the **Free Software Foundation**, means that the author of the software made with this licencie demands that the beneficiaries of the product preserve the same liberties associated to the distribution of copies and their derivativos.

- _GNU General Public License (GPL)_: Created by the FSF. Offers the liberty to use, study, share and modify software. It is **copyleft**, so its derivative software must also be GPL.

The **Open Source Initiative (OSI)** developed a standardized procedure to corroborate that the software licencies comply with the Open Source Definition.

- _FreeBSD License_: Contained into the **permissive licenses** that do not contain **copyleft**. So the software can be restricted and sold (therefore it stops being Open Source), but it also includes an extended responsive clausule and it must be complied with.
