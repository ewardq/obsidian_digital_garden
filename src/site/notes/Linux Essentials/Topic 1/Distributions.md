# Distributions
A **distribution** is a Operating System created with the Linux kernel and a selection of application software maintained by a community or a company.

A graph of the many dist. variants and its origins can be seen here:

There are two main families of distributions:

| Debian variants                                             | Red Hat variants                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Software is managed by **.deb** packages and dpkg, apt, ... | Software is managed by **.rpm** files and rpm, yum, dnf, ... |
| Ubuntu, Kali, Mint, MX Link, etc.                           | Fedora, CentOS, Scientific Linux, etc.                       |
Honorable mentions: Suse, Arch, Manjaro, ...

But why exists so many distributions? Each one is made and optimized for a specific purpose and includes only the desired software packages. So it's important to know [[how to choose the right distribution\|how to choose the right distribution]].
