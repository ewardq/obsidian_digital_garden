There are two main ways that Linux distributes software:

_Via source code_: where you can get your software from [[Linux Essentials/Topic 1/repositories\|repositories]] in a human-readable form to modify and thinker with.
	**Advantages:** can be [[compiled\|compiled]] in the specific environment where it'll be run to optimize performance. Can be modified and personalized.
	**Disadvantages:** need the specific programs to interpret the human-readable source code and required libraries. Slower and more complex installation.	 
	
_Via installable files called [[Linux Essentials/Topic 1/Software Packages\|Software Packages]]_: created to make the installation process easier to execute, understand and manage, "packages" were created as a set of files with all the necessary dependencies and information to install an application. 
	**Advantages**: Easier to install and administrate.
	**Disadvantages**: the same program needs different packages depending on their platform (x86, x64, arm, mips, ...). Some packages are incompatible.
