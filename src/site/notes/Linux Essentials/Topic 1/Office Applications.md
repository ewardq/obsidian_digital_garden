# Office Applications
Office applications are used for editing files such as texts, presentations, spreadsheets and other formats used in an office environment. _OpenOffice.org_ was the most famous open source suite until Oracle bought it and now the _LibreOffice_ fork replaced it. Both are composed of:

_Writer_: text processer
_Calc_: spreadsheet
_Impress_: presentations
_Draw:_ vector drawing
_Inkscape:_ SVG files editing, vector drawing
_Math_: math formulas
_Base_: databases
