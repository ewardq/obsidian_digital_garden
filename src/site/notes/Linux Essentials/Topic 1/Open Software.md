Even though Open Source (Open Software) and Free Software are similar terms, they are not the same. If the Source Code is publish, it's open Source, but this doesn't mean that the other liberties related to free software are met.  
The source code might be available but it doesn't necessarily mean that the software is free to distribute or free to modify.
