___Print newline, word, and byte counts for each file.___

> [! Tip] Syntax
	wc [OPTION]... [FILE]...
	wc [OPTION]... --files0-from=F

Print newline, word, and byte counts for each `FILE`, and a total line if more than one `FILE` is specified. With no `FILE`, or when `FILE` is `-`, read standard input.
