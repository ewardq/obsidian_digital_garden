- They are used to **describe situations or scenarios of your application** (Modelling the life cycle of a reactive object through interconnections of states).
- FSMs are **helpful to model complex applications** that involve lots of decision-making, producing different outputs (actions), and processing various events.
- State machines are visualized through state machine diagrams in the form of state charts, which **helps to communicate between non-developers and developers**.
- Makes it easier to visualize and implement the changes to the behavior of the project.
- Complex application can be visualized as a collection of different states processing a fixed set of events and producing a fixed set of outputs.
- **Loose coupling**: An application can be divided into multiple behaviors or state machines, and each unit can be tested separately or could be reused in other applications.
- Scalable
- Narrow down whole application complexity to state level complexity, analyze and implement.
