> [!abstract]- AWS Management Console
> The **AWS Management Console** is a web-based interface for accessing and managing AWS services. You can quickly access recently used services and search for other services by name, keyword, or acronym. The console includes wizards and automated workflows that can simplify the process of completing tasks.

> [!abstract]- AWS Command Line Interface
>To save time when making API requests, you can use the **AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)**. AWS CLI enables you to control multiple AWS services directly from the command line within one tool. AWS CLI is available for users on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

> [!abstract]- Software Development Kit
> Another option for accessing and managing AWS services is the **software development kits (SDKs)**. SDKs make it easier for you to use AWS services through an API designed for your programming language or platform. SDKs enable you to use AWS services with your existing applications or create entirely new applications that will run on AWS.
> 
> Supported programming languages include C++, Java, .NET, and more.
