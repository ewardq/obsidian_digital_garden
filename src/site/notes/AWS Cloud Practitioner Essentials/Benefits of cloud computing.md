Why would a company choose to use certain cloud computing to met business needs?

- ==Trade upfront expense for variable expense:== When taking a variable expense approach, the company limits the initial cost of running IT resources and assures the efficiency of paying only for the resources they need.
- ==Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers:== The benefit of cloud computing is the ability to focus more on applications and customers instead of focusing on maintaining servers and infrastructure.
- ==Stop guessing capacity:== Instead of predicting future infrastructure needs, adapt accordingly with the cloud.
- ==Benefits from massive economies of scale:== By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own.
- ==Increase speed and agility:== Instead of first getting the ability to test certain scenarios and ideas by demanding more company infrastructure, experiment with AWS cloud computing on-demand tools.
- ==Go global in minutes:== The global footprint of the AWS Cloud enables you to deploy applications to customers around the world quickly, while providing them with low latency.
