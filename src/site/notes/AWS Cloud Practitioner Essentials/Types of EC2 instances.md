[[Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) \| Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances]] are optimized for different tasks. To choose from the right one for you, take into consideration the types and characteristics of each one:

- ==General purpose instances== provide a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources. <u>Use this type of EC2 for applications that do not require optimization in any single resource area.</u>

- ==Compute optimized instances== are ideal for compute-bound applications that benefic from high-performance processors. <u>These EC2 are ideal for high-performance web-servers, compute-intensive applications servers, and dedicated gaming servers.</u>

- ==Memory optimized instances== are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large datasets in memory (temporary storage area). The memory holds are the data and instructions that a central processing unit (CPU) needs to be able to complete actions. <u>Ideal for workload that requires large amounts of data to be preloaded before running an application.</u>

- ==Accelerated computing instances== use hardware accelerators, or coprocessors, to perform some functions more efficiently than is possible in software running on CPUs. <u>Accelerated computing instances are ideal for workloads such as graphics applications, game streaming, and application streaming.</u>

- ==Storage optimized instances== are designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to large datasets on local storage. <u>Examples of workloads suitable for storage optimized instances include distributed file systems, data warehousing applications, and high-frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems.</u>
