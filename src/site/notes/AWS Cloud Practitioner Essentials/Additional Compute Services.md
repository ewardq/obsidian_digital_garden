If you have applications that you want to run in Amazon EC2, you must do the following:

1. Provision instances (virtual servers).
2. Upload your code.
3. Continue to manage the instances while your application is running.

==The term “serverless” means that your code runs on servers, but you do not need to provision or manage these servers.== With serverless computing, you can focus more on innovating new products and features instead of maintaining servers.
