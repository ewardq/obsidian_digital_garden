An Availability Zone is a single data center or a group of data centers within a [[AWS Regions \| Region]]. Availability Zones are located tens of miles apart from each other. This is ==close enough to have low latency== (the time between when content requested and received) between Availability Zones. However, if a disaster occurs in one part of the Region, they are distant enough to ==reduce the chance that multiple Availability Zones are affected.==
