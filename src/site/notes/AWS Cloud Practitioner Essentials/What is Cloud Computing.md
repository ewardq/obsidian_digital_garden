==On demand delivering==: It is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

==Undifferentiated heavy lifting of IT==: These are the task that are common, often repetitive and time consuming.

==Over the internet==: Implies that you can access those resources with webpages.

==Pay-as-you-go pricing==

When selecting a cloud strategy, a company must consider why would they want a cloud AWS solution. 

There are three cloud comping deployment models:

## ==Cloud-based deployment==

- Run all parts of the application in the cloud.
- Migrate existing applications to the cloud.
- Design and build new applications in the cloud.

## ==On-premises deployment // Private cloud deployment==

- Deploy resources by using virtualization and resource management tools.
- Increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualization technologies.

Resources are fully kept in-premises by using virtualization and resource management tools.

## ==Hybrid deployment==

- Connect cloud-based resources to on-premises infrastructure.
- Integrate cloud-based resources with legacy IT applications.

If there is a need to keep some application in-premises due to the impossibility of migration or privacy concerns, a hybrid approach may be better to met the requirements of the applications and get the benefits of the cloud.

Why would a company choose to use certain cloud computing to met business needs?

- ==Trade upfront expense for variable expense:== When taking a variable expense approach, the company limits the initial cost of running IT resources and assures the efficiency of paying only for the resources they need.

- ==Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers:== The benefit of cloud computing is the ability to focus more on applications and customers instead of focusing on maintaining servers and infrastructure.

- ==Stop guessing capacity:== Instead of predicting future infrastructure needs, adapt accordingly with the cloud.

- ==Benefits from massive economies of scale:== By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own.

- ==Increase speed and agility:== Instead of first getting the ability to test certain scenarios and ideas by demanding more company infrastructure, experiment with AWS cloud computing on-demand tools.

- ==Go global in minutes:== The global footprint of the AWS Cloud enables you to deploy applications to customers around the world quickly, while providing them with low latency.
