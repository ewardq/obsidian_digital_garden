## Scalability
Involves beginning with only the resources you need and designing your architecture to automatically respond to changing demand by scaling out or in.

==Pay only the resources you use with Amazon Auto Scaling== 

## Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling enables you to automatically add or remove Amazon EC2 instances in response to changing application demand.

Within Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, you can use two approaches: dynamic scaling and predictive scaling.

- _Dynamic scaling_ responds to changing demand. 
- _Predictive scaling_ automatically schedules the right number of Amazon EC2 instances based on predicted demand.
