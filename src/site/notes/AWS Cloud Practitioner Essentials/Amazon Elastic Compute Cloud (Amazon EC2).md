This service from Amazon provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud as Amazon EC2 instances.

With an Amazon EC2 instance you can use a virtual server to run applications in the AWS Cloud, where you can:

- Provision and launch Amazon EC2 instances within minutes
- Stop using it when you have finished running a workload.
- Pay only for the compute time you use when an instance is running, not when it is stopped or terminated.
- Save costs by paying only for server capacity that you need or want.
