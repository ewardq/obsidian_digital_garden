When selecting a cloud strategy, a company must consider why would they want a cloud AWS solution. 

There are three cloud comping deployment models:

## ==Cloud-based deployment==

- Run all parts of the application in the cloud.
- Migrate existing applications to the cloud.
- Design and build new applications in the cloud.

## ==On-premises deployment // Private cloud deployment==

- Deploy resources by using virtualization and resource management tools.
- Increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualization technologies.

Resources are fully kept in-premises by using virtualization and resource management tools.

## ==Hybrid deployment==

- Connect cloud-based resources to on-premises infrastructure.
- Integrate cloud-based resources with legacy IT applications.

If there is a need to keep some application in-premises due to the impossibility of migration or privacy concerns, a hybrid approach may be better to met the requirements of the applications and get the benefits of the cloud.
