ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!
I'm currently an embedded software test engineer aspiring to take the leap into developing professionally. I focus focus mainly on Linux, Python, C++, Embedded Systems, Operating Systems, the Cloud and more!

This is an ongoing project to document and store my personal projects and notes. Here are some of those:
