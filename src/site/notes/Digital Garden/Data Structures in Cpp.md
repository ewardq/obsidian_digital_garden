 C++ is a **strongly typed** programming language where every variable has a type, name, value and location in memory.

### C++ Types

The **type** of a variable defines the contents of the variable. Every **type** es either:

- [[Data Structures in Cpp/Primitive type\|Primitive type]]
- [[Data Structures in Cpp/User-defined type\|User-defined type]]
