 C++ is a **strongly typed** programming language where every variable has a type, name, value and location in memory.

### C++ Types

The **type** of a variable defines the contents of the variable. Every **type** es either:

- [[Data Structures in Cpp/Writing a C++ Program/Primitive type\|Primitive type]]
- [[Data Structures in Cpp/Writing a C++ Program/User-defined type\|User-defined type]]

### C++ Programs

Every C++ program must contain a starting point. By the C++ standard, the starting point is a function:

```c++
int main()
```

By ___convention___, the return value of main is `0` (zero) if the program was successful and non-zero on errors.
