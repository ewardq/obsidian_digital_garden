#### What is a State Machine (FSM)?
A state machine is a software model of computation, and it comprises finite number states. Hence it is also called a **Finite State Machine** (FSM).

Since **states are finite**, there is a finite number of transitions among the states. Transitions are triggered by the input events fed to the state machine (FSM is an event-driven system).
A state machine also produces an output. The output produced depends on the current state of the state machine and the input events fed to the state machine.
